👋 Hi, I’m @MilkyVRC. Or MilkySenpai on VrChat 🥽

🎮 For past 4 years I been interested in VR as a consumer and as of last year I been learning how to use Unity & Blender to create my own content in a popular VR platform [VRChat](https://hello.vrchat.com/).

🎨 Here's some of my artsy 3d/VR projects [ArtStation](https://www.artstation.com/milkysenpai) and also a video on twitter of one my [VRWorlds](https://twitter.com/vrpill/status/1298025290455814144).

🥰 Hope you have a great day 🥰
